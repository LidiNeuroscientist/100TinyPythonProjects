print('\033[1;97m--' * 10, 'üèäüèªSWIMMING AGE CLASSIFICATION','--' * 10 )
import datetime
y = int(input('Type your YEAR of birth:\033[m '))
now = datetime.date.today().year
t = now - y
if t <= 9:
    print('\033[1;31mYou are {} years old: Classified as CHILD\033[m'.format(t))
elif t > 9 and t <= 14:
    print('\033[1;32mYou are {} years old: Classified as JUVENILE\033[m'.format(t))
elif t > 14 and t <= 19:
    print('\033[1;33mYou are {} years old: Classified as JUNIOR\033[m'.format(t))
