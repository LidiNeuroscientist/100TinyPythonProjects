'''ANALYZING AND GENERATING DICTIONARIES

Write a program that has a function called grades() that can receive several
grades from students and will return a dictionary with the following information:
A) Number of grades
B) The highest score
C) The lowest score
D) The class average
E) The optional situation

also add the function docstrings '''
